# Recommender-for-movie-snobs
This project developed simple metrics of movie snobbery to address bias in recommender systems. 
Working with the various stereotypes of hipsters, I found that movie snobbery is best defined as an interest in older movies and obscure movies. Extremeness of ratings (like Statler & Waldorf in The Muppets) is not a good indicator of snobbery.
This analysis was run by joining a canonical list of movies to a Grouplens movie rating dataset.
These findings might be applied to tweak recommender systems by allowing for a cooler-older-sibling/sage/guide function, a possibly more elegant solution to 'alt-right'/Star-Wars drift than direct content curation.
