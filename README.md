# Recommender-for-movie-snobs
This project developed simple metrics of movie snobbery, working with the various stereotypes of hipsters. These findings might be applied to tweak recommender systems.
I found that movie snobbery is best defined as an interest in older movies and obscure movies. Extremeness of ratings (like Statler & Waldorf in The Muppets) is not a good indicator of snobbery.
This analysis was run by joining a canonical list of movies to a Grouplens movie rating dataset.
